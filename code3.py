# In the code the main cahnge is done fro line 6. the intial code gave me an error becasue sample.txt was not created so i chaged the code by adding an if statement to 1st chek if sample.txt is present or not, if it is not present then create a new file for sample.txt. For the this th additional change required is in line one is import or to access the underlying operating system
